%% This is a sample manuscript marked up using the
%% AASTeX v6.2 LaTeX 2e macros.
%%
%% AASTeX is now based on Alexey Vikhlinin's emulateapj.cls 
%% (Copyright 2000-2015).  See the classfile for details.

%% AASTeX requires revtex4-1.cls (http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/) and
%% other external packages (latexsym, graphicx, amssymb, longtable, and epsf).
%% All of these external packages should already be present in the modern TeX 
%% distributions.  If not they can also be obtained at www.ctan.org.

%% The first piece of markup in an AASTeX v6.x document is the \documentclass
%% command. LaTeX will ignore any data that comes before this command. The 
%% documentclass can take an optional argument to modify the output style.
%% The command below calls the preprint style  which will produce a tightly 
%% typeset, one-column, single-spaced document.  It is the default and thus
%% does not need to be explicitly stated.
%%
%%
%% using aastex version 6.2
\documentclass[modern]{aastex62}

%% The default is a single spaced, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%% There are 5 other style options available via an optional argument. They
%% can be envoked like this:
%%
%% \documentclass[argument]{aastex62}
%% 
%% where the layout options are:
%%
%%  twocolumn   : two text columns, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%%                This is the most compact and represent the final published
%%                derived PDF copy of the accepted manuscript from the publisher
%%  manuscript  : one text column, 12 point font, double spaced article.
%%  preprint    : one text column, 12 point font, single spaced article.  
%%  preprint2   : two text columns, 12 point font, single spaced article.
%%  modern      : a stylish, single text column, 12 point font, article with
%% 		  wider left and right margins. This uses the Daniel
%% 		  Foreman-Mackey and David Hogg design.
%%  RNAAS       : Preferred style for Research Notes which are by design 
%%                lacking an abstract and brief. DO NOT use \begin{abstract}
%%                and \end{abstract} with this style.
%%
%% Note that you can submit to the AAS Journals in any of these 6 styles.
%%
%% There are other optional arguments one can envoke to allow other stylistic
%% actions. The available options are:
%%
%%  astrosymb    : Loads Astrosymb font and define \astrocommands. 
%%  tighten      : Makes baselineskip slightly smaller, only works with 
%%                 the twocolumn substyle.
%%  times        : uses times font instead of the default
%%  linenumbers  : turn on lineno package.
%%  trackchanges : required to see the revision mark up and print its output
%%  longauthor   : Do not use the more compressed footnote style (default) for 
%%                 the author/collaboration/affiliations. Instead print all
%%                 affiliation information after each name. Creates a much
%%                 long author list but may be desirable for short author papers
%%
%% these can be used in any combination, e.g.
%%
%% \documentclass[twocolumn,linenumbers,trackchanges]{aastex62}
%%
%% AASTeX v6.* now includes \hyperref support. While we have built in specific
%% defaults into the classfile you can manually override them with the
%% \hypersetup command. For example,
%%
%%\hypersetup{linkcolor=red,citecolor=green,filecolor=cyan,urlcolor=magenta}
%%
%% will change the color of the internal links to red, the links to the
%% bibliography to green, the file links to cyan, and the external links to
%% magenta. Additional information on \hyperref options can be found here:
%% https://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html#x1-40003
%%
%% If you want to create your own macros, you can do so
%% using \newcommand. Your macros should appear before
%% the \begin{document} command.

\begin{abstract}
The recent detection of circularly polarized, variable low-frequency radio emission from the M4.5~dwarf GJ\,1151 has been interpreted as a Jupiter-like electron cyclotron maser instability arising from star-planet interaction. The existence or parameters of the proposed planets have not been determined. In order to search for any planets or binary companions, we have obtained new HARPS-N observations

Using these data we do not detect a clear planetary signal, and we put $99^{\text{th}}$-percentile upper limits on the mass of any companion to GJ\,1151 at 5.1~\mearth. 

We infer interpolated, high-SNR, high-resolution spectra of GJ\,1151.

\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec:intro}

Exoplanet science has flourished over the last three decades to be one of the major topics in optical astronomy. The number of known planets has doubled nearly every two years since 1995 \citep{Mamajek2016} and this accelerating rate of discovery is projected to continue for at least the next decade if current and upcoming space-based surveys deliver their expected results. However despite extensive searches \citep{2000ApJ...545.1058B,2013A&A...552A..65L,Lynch18} neither exoplanets nor their host stars have been detected at radio frequencies, as the quiescent emission of such systems has been too faint for current telescopes. But as the Square Kilometre Array \citep[SKA;][]{2009IEEEP..97.1482D} and its precursors, in particular LOFAR \citep[the LOw-Frequency ARray:][]{lofar} come online, the orders-of-magnitude increase in sensitivity and survey speed they provide makes the detection of nearby stars and planets a realistic prospect \citep{pope19}. 

High stellar UV flux and flaring are thought to pose serious problems for habitability of planets around M~dwarfs \citep{Shields16,2019AsBio..19...64T}, though this may be not sufficiently severe in comparison to the early Earth to prevent the emergence of life \citep{2019MNRAS.485.5598O}. The stellar wind potentially poses a more severe problem. Star-planet interactions analogous to the magnetic interaction of Jupiter and Io are theorized to occur when a planet lies within the Alfv\'{e}n surface of their host star, where the planet is magnetically connected to its star and their magnetospheres are not separated by shocks. This is thought to be the case for Proxima~Centauri~b \citep{2016ApJ...833L...4G} and the inner TRAPPIST-1 planets \citep{2017ApJ...843L..33G}.  With stellar wind flux orders of magnitude higher than that received by Earth, this may be a leading-order effect for stripping otherwise-habitable exoplanets of their atmospheres. The search for the associated radio aurorae from M~dwarf planets is therefore a key component of understanding their long term evolution and habitability \citep{2017ApJ...849L..10B,2018ApJ...854...72T,2019arXiv190607089V}, but observational signatures of this have not so far been detected \citep[e.g.][]{Lynch18,Lenc18}.

Rather than explicitly searching for radio emission from known exoplanet hosts, \citet{Callingham_2019} cross-matched sources identified by the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey \citep[LoTSS:][]{lotss} with nearby stellar sources found by \gaia, finding the great majority of matches to be chance associations. But by restricting the survey to variable and circularly-polarized emission, the rate of chance associations with background radio galaxies is dramatically reduced. Based on this restricted cross-match, Vedantham et al. (submitted) have detected the M4.5 dwarf GJ\,1151 at low radio frequencies with LOFAR, finding a high degree of circular polarization and low X-ray luminosity consistent with a possible star-planet magnetic interaction. While M~dwarfs are known to flare at low frequencies \citep[e.g.][]{Villadsen19}, this emission shows a stead on/off duty cycle like that of electron cyclotron maser instability (ECMI) emission from Jupiter.

In this Letter we analyze new HARPS-N \citep[High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher:][]{harpsn} observations of GJ\,1151 in order to search for radial velocity signals of the proposed planets. We do not detect any planets, but place strong upper limits of a few Earth masses on the $M\sin{i}$ of any possible companions, ruling out any short-period massive objects or close binary companion.  

\section{RV Data}
\label{sec:k2}

We obtained 20 epochs of observations of GJ\,1151 with HARPS-N from 2018-12-20 to 2019-02-27, as a Director's Discretionary Time program. While RVs were extracted from these using the standard HARPS pipeline, its performance on this M4.5 dwarf was very poor, resulting in a spurious RV scatter of several km/s. We therefore reprocessed these data using \textit{wobble} \citep{wobble}, a data-driven package which simultaneously non-parametrically constructs a stellar spectral template and telluric spectral components and uses these, rather than model spectral masks, to extract radial velocities. 

We found that the second epoch (2018-12-22) had a significantly higher extracted RV uncertainty than the others, and accordingly excluded this from the global \textit{wobble} model. In order to assess template-dependent systematic errors, we conducted a `leave-one-out' cross-validation, excluding one additional epoch at a time and rerunning \textit{wobble} to search for consistency between the outputs. As seen in Figure~\ref{xvalidation}, the different resulting time series are broadly consistent in their directions of deviation from the mean, with a scatter between them of order $\sim$ the quoted uncertainties. We therefore believe the uncertainties on the \textit{wobble} RVs are realistic but that they are also model-dependent systematics, and therefore likely correlated.

There is overall consistency between the different time series, with a diversity of order $\sim$ the quoted uncertainty between the individual realizations. % redo for complete cross-validation and final epoch added in

\section{Keplerian Inference}
\label{sec:joker}

We use \textit{the Joker} pipeline \citep{joker}, which is optimized for small numbers of irregularly-spaced observations, to fit Keplerian signals and infer posterior planet parameters. We allow an additional astrophysical jitter (white noise) term to vary with a lognormal prior on jitter $\ln {(s/(\text{m/s}))^2} \sim {N}(1,2)$ for GJ\,1151.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\citet{2019arXiv190505900H} using \kepler estimate that M3-M5 dwarfs host $1.19^{+0.70}_{−0.49}$ planets per star with radii from $0.5-2.5 R_\oplus$ and periods from  0.5-10\,d, the detection of a planet is actually less important than the exclusion of \emph{non}-planetary models, such as emission from a stellar binary interaction. We can confidently say that there is no short-period stellar binary companion to GJ~1151, and that the posterior for the RV trend of $0.02 \pm 0.03$ m/$\text{s}^{-1}\text{d}^{-1}$ is consistent with zero at $1\,\sigma$. 

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

The results of this analysis conclusively rule out binary companions or planets on short orbits more massive than Neptune as the origin of the radio signal from GJ\,1151. We nevertheless cannot rule out in either case planets less massive than a few Earth masses. Given that Vedantham et al. (submitted) find that even a planet with a mass around that of $\sim$Mercury could explain these signals, there is a very large region of parameter space for these planets that cannot be excluded and the star-planet interaction hypothesis remains reasonable. 

Because our target is so red, to achieve significantly higher precision than attained by HARPS would require moving to the infrared, using one of the IR precision RV instruments currently being commissioned, such as the Habitable-zone Planet Finder \citep[HPF:][]{hpf} or CARMENES \citep{carmenes}, by which GJ\,1151 is already subject to monitoring \citep{carmenesinput}.
